# Defects-in-nanomaterials
Code, used in a study of planar defects in platinum-copper nanoparticles as hydrogen fuel cell electrocatalysts.

This repository contains code to generate crystallographic files of modulated PtCu<sub>3</sub> unit cells containing anti-phase boundaries and to simulate diffraction patterns for twinned PtCu<sub>3</sub> Pm-3m crystallites, as well as helper functions to generate models of (supported) nanoparticles for STEM image simulation and to plot results for publication.

If you use the code, please cite the following paper:
